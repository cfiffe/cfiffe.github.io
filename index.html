    <h1>Hi I am Cheryl
      
     <h3> Welcome to my website!</h3>
      
    <p> I am a freshman at Coral Gables Senior High. I've lived in Miami my whole life, but have travelled to different places across the globe. I love travelling because I can learn about different cultures and experience new things.
     Let me tell you about some of the different places I've visited!

      <h3 class="underline"> Paris, France </h3>
      <p> Paris is known around the world as city of love, lights, and fashion. Its distinctive architecture is representative of its rich history,  as it has always been a center of culture. Despite being a metropolis, it has preserved its history in some of the most iconic buildings of the city, including the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe.
       It has great cuisine, and for the art fanatics, there extremely interesting museums located in the city where you can observe some of the greatest pieces of art in history, such as the Louvre. Paris truly lives up to its reputation as an epicenter of French culture, and I would love to visit it again.
