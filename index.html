    <h1>Hi I am Cheryl
      
     <h3> Welcome to my website!</h3>
      
    <p> I am a freshman at Coral Gables Senior High. I've lived in Miami my whole life, but have travelled to different places across the globe. I love travelling because I can learn about different cultures and experience new things.
     Let me tell you about some of the different places I've visited!
